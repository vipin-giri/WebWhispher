# 🕵️‍♂️ WEBWHISPER

Advanced Domain Discovery Engine with live verification, automated deduplication, CT-log intelligence, colorful CLI, auto-saving, and real-time status checking.

Designed for security researchers, OSINT analysts, and bug bounty hunters who need continuous unique domain discovery with live HTTP 200 verification.

## 📸 Overview

WebWhisper is a CT-log-powered domain discovery tool that fetches real, freshly-issued domains from Certificate Transparency logs (crt.sh) and verifies they're live with HTTP 200 responses.
It guarantees zero duplicates, automatic saving, and instant live domain verification.

### Key Highlights:

- ⚡ Fast real-time domain discovery (Certificate Transparency based)
- ✅ Live domain verification (HTTP 200 status checking)
- 🧠 Built-in deduplication with SQLite persistence
- 📝 Auto-saves each scan to timestamped .txt files
- 🎨 Beautiful colorized terminal output
- 🌐 30+ default TLDs for comprehensive coverage
- 🧪 Offline sampling mode from stored DB
- 🚀 Multi-threaded live checking (20 concurrent threads)
- 🎯 Perfect for reconnaissance, OSINT, and bug bounty hunting

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Fetch real domains from Certificate Transparency logs
- 🔴 Verify domains are live with HTTP 200 status
- 🔁 Never repeats a domain (SHA-256 deduplication)
- 📂 Auto-save every scan to timestamped .txt files (YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_domains.txt)
- 🎨 Clean, colorized terminal interface with progress indicators
- 📡 Multi-TLD scanning (30+ TLDs by default)
- 🧰 Offline mode — sample DB without network
- 🧼 Clean domain normalization (wildcard removal, lowercasing)
- ⚡ Fast concurrent checking (20 parallel connections)
- 🎚 Configurable max-fetch limits
- 📊 Real-time progress display with ✓/✗ indicators
- 🎛 Easy to extend for automation

## 🧱 Requirements

- 🐍 Python 3.8+
- 🌐 Internet connection (for CT log fetching and live verification)
- 📦 Dependencies from requirements.txt

### Dependencies:

```
requests==2.31.0
urllib3==2.1.0
```

## 📦 Installation

### 1️⃣ Download the script

- `scanner.py`
- `requirements.txt`

Put both into the same folder.

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Make executable (optional)

```bash
chmod +x scanner.py
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic usage (25 live domains with all default TLDs):

```bash
python scanner.py
```

### Get specific number of live domains:

```bash
python scanner.py --count 100
```

### Get 1000 live domains:

```bash
python scanner.py --count 1000
```

### Use specific TLDs only:

```bash
python scanner.py --count 500 --tlds com,net,org
```

### Skip live verification (faster, may return offline domains):

```bash
python scanner.py --count 1000 --no-verify
```

### Use cached domains only (offline mode):

```bash
python scanner.py --count 50 --use-cache-only
```
## ⚙️ Command-Line Options

| Option | Short | Description | Default |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--count` | `-n` | Number of unique live domains to return | 25 |
| `--tlds` | | Comma-separated TLD list | 30 common TLDs |
| `--no-verify` | | Skip live verification (faster) | False |
| `--use-cache-only` | | Use DB cache only, no remote fetch | False |

### Default TLDs (30 total):
com, net, org, io, co, uk, de, fr, ca, au, jp, cn, in, br, ru, nl, it, es, se, no, pl, be, ch, at, dk, fi, cz, pt, gr, nz

## 📂 File Output

**Auto-saved scan results:**
- `20241209_154200_domains.txt`
- `20241209_154918_domains.txt`
- `20241209_160532_domains.txt`

**SQLite Database:**
- `webwhisper_db.db` (stores all seen domains with SHA-256 fingerprints)

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Fetch** - Queries crt.sh Certificate Transparency logs for specified TLDs
2. **Deduplicate** - Checks SQLite DB to ensure domain hasn't been seen before
3. **Verify** - Tests each domain with HTTP/HTTPS requests for 200 status
4. **Store** - Marks verified domains as seen in database
5. **Save** - Auto-saves results to timestamped .txt file

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For maximum results:
```bash
python scanner.py --count 1000 --tlds com,net,org,io,co,uk,de,fr,ca,au
```

### For speed (skip verification):
```bash
python scanner.py --count 5000 --no-verify
```

### For testing offline:
```bash
python scanner.py --count 100 --use-cache-only
```

### Reset database:
```bash
rm webwhisper_db.db
```

## 📊 Expected Results

- **Live verification enabled**: Typically 20-40% of domains return HTTP 200
- **Processing speed**: ~20 domains/second with live checking
- **Without verification**: Much faster, but may include offline domains

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Rate limiting**: Script includes 1-second delay between crt.sh requests
- **SSL verification**: Disabled for domains with certificate issues
- **Timeout**: 5 seconds per domain for live checking
- **Concurrent threads**: 20 parallel connections for speed
- **First run**: Slower as it builds the database cache

## ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Use

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:**
WebWhisper is designed for OSINT, research, and authorized reconnaissance ONLY.

You must follow:

- Local laws and regulations
- Target's policies and terms of service
- Bug bounty program rules
- Ethical hacking guidelines
- Responsible disclosure practices

**The tool performs HTTP requests to discovered domains. Ensure you have permission for any further security testing.**

Misuse is strictly discouraged and may be illegal.

## 🤝 Contributing

- Web interface
- Performance optimizations

Submit pull requests or open GitHub issues.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No domains found"
- Check internet connection
- Try different TLDs: `--tlds com,net,org`
- Increase count: `--count 500`

### "crt.sh timeout"
- crt.sh may be rate-limiting or down
- Wait a few minutes and retry
- Use `--use-cache-only` to work offline

### "Too slow"
- Use `--no-verify` to skip live checking
- Reduce count
- Use fewer TLDs

### Database corruption
```bash
rm webwhisper_db.db
python scanner.py --count 100
```
